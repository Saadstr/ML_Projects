Apple Stock Price Prediction
Problem Statement
This project aims to predict the next day closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock using historical market data. 

What I Did
Collected historical Apple stock price and volume data from Kaggle.
Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.
Built two machine learning models: Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression.
Trained the models on past data to predict the next day’s closing price.
Evaluated model performance using R^2 scores and calculated how far off the predictions were from actual values.
Visualized actual vs predicted prices to assess model accuracy.

Results
Both models showed reasonable accuracy, with the Random Forest model generally performing better at capturing complex patterns.
The Linear Regression model provided a good baseline with interpretable results.
The prediction offset for the last day’s price was around $0.62, indicating how close the models came to the actual closing price.
